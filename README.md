# VirtualHuman.com – Domain For Sale Landing Page

Welcome! This repository contains the code for the [VirtualHuman.com](https://virtualhuman.com) domain-for-sale landing page.

## Purpose

This site serves as a landing page to inform visitors that VirtualHuman.com is available for purchase and to collect inquiries from interested buyers.

## Features

- Modern, mobile-friendly design
- Clearly communicates that VirtualHuman.com is for sale
- Contact form (e.g., Formspree) for easy buyer inquiries
- Automatically detects and displays the current domain name
- Fast, static HTML/CSS/JS for deployment on any web host

## Usage

1. **Clone or download this repository.**
2. **Edit content as needed** (update contact info, form endpoint, features, etc.) in `index.html`.
3. **Deploy to your preferred static host** (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, cPanel, etc.).
4. **Point your DNS** so VirtualHuman.com resolves to your hosting provider.

## Customization

- Update the domain name in the header and throughout the site as needed.
- Change the form endpoint to your own (e.g., Formspree or another provider) to receive inquiries.
- Adjust styles, text, or features to suit your preferences or branding.

## DNS Setup

For best results, use a CNAME (for subdomains) or ALIAS/ANAME or A record (for root domains) to point VirtualHuman.com to your host.  
Avoid HTTP redirects as this can interfere with domain detection and form tracking.
